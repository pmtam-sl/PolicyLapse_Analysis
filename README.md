# Insurance Policy Lapse Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for a project focused on understanding and predicting insurance policy lapses. The analysis is divided into three key parts: logistic regression, exploratory data analysis, and policy lapse prediction using TidyMode.

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore factors contributing to policy lapses and predict the likelihood of a lapse using statistical and machine learning techniques in R.

### Part 1: Explore Policy Lapse with Logistic Regression
- **Objective**: Identify key factors that influence the likelihood of a policy lapse.
- **Method**: Logistic regression is applied to the dataset to model the relationship between policy characteristics and the probability of a lapse.

### Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Policy Lapse
- **Objective**: Perform a comprehensive data exploration to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns.
- **Techniques**: Data visualization and statistical summaries using `ggplot2` and `dplyr` in R to better understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.

### Part 3: Policy Lapse Prediction using TidyMode
- **Objective**: Build predictive models to forecast the likelihood of a policy lapse.
- **Method**: Use TidyMode, a tidy approach to machine learning in R, to fit and evaluate models for predicting policy lapses.
